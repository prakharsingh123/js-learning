                        <h1>The revolt of 1857:</h1>
                        <p>The Indian Mutiny, also known as the Sepoy Mutiny, ignited the first spark of the revolution.
                           It began in Meerut and later spread to Delhi, Agra, Kanpur, and Lucknow. It was quite widespread.</p>

                          <p>It was the first satyagraha inspired by Mahatma Gandhi. The farmers in the Champaran district of Bihar were being forced to grow indigo.
                             Besides, they were barely paid anything for their produce. This led to a farmer’s uprising.</p>

                             In addition, Gandhiji made a call to Do or Die in his Quit India speech that he delivered in Bombay.</p>
